                <p>My name is Frederic Michel Ortega, I am 
                    21 years old, and I am studying computer science engineering (Bachelor of engineering)
                    at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am currently the President of the Tennis Society.

                <h3 class="my-3" style="color:white; text-align:center"><span style="background-color:black">My Web Development Journey_</span></h3>
                <p> My hobby lies in web development. I started my journey in June 2022, where I started by learning HTML and CSS 
                    on the w3schools website. Then, having built the foundations, I have decided to take two courses on Coursera. 
                    In the first course, I learnt bootstrap, and in the second course, I learnt Angular js. Through these courses, I have conducted projects, which were 
                    my first hands on experience with web development. 
                    Then, I realised that Angular might have hidden a lot of aspects of web development, which must be understood on my own, and I decided
                    to learn Javascript, Express js, and SQL through the intermediary of Code Academy. This was perhaps the best decision I took, as it really
                    helped me to understand how a server interacts with a client, to deliver static data as well as dynamic behaviors. 
                    With such knowledge, I decided to start my first project, the CTG manager (see corresponding page), where I learnt on the way multiple skills, 
                    including authentication, express sessions, and the transition library, GSAP.
                </p>
                <p>However I was still not satisfied, and I did not like the idea of relying onto only one language (javascript) 
                    to develop web applications. Therefore I decided to learn python, and learnt the framework Django. 
                    I learnt Django on w3schools, and quickly applied my knowledge with my biggest project so far: The Tennis Society Website.
                    Being the president of the Tennis Society, I decided to build a website for both the members, and the executive committe to use, which was adopted and deployed, and 
                    greatly simplified the management of the society (see corresponding project page). Through this project, I further learnt Query sets, database Modeling, and web tokens.
                </p>
                <p>Now, I have learnt React js, and react native, through code academy, and my current ambition lies in another big project, developping a mobile app, with my family, where 
                    I will be using another type of server API, more specifically GraphQL API, and using a NoSQL database such as MongoDB.
